Tutorial 2 -  Pseudocode for main game loop
In this tutorial we begin to flesh out a structure for our code, 
specifically the main game loop.  

We begin that process by creating a 'blueprint' for our game 
loop through a process called pseudo-programming (or pseudocode).

'''Pseudo-programming (pseudocode):
Pseudo-code is an informal way to express the design of a 
computer program or an algorithm.  The aim is to get the idea quickly 
and also easy to read without details.  It is like a young child 
putting sentences together without any grammar.  There are several ways 
of writing pseudo-code; there are no strict rules.  But to reduce ambiguity 
between what you are required to do and what you express letâ€™s base the 
pseudo code on the few defined conventions'''

def game_main_loop():
    '''This function loops the main game'''

    #TODO create a variable to control when the game ends, set it to False

    #TODO game while loop:
        #TODO get player input
        #TODO process input
        #TODO draw the game

    #TODO quit the game

def game_init():
    '''This function initialises the main window and pygame'''

    #TODO make a global (available to all modules) variable to hold the game window (surface)
    #TODO initialise pygame
    #TODO create window (surface)

#TODO call the functions to make the game run
